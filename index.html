              <h4>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)</h4>
              <p>
                The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which translates to Pakistan
                Movement for Justice, is a political party in Pakistan founded
                by Imran Khan in 1996. PTI emerged as a major player in
                Pakistani politics, advocating for anti-corruption, social
                justice, and welfare programs. Imran Khan's charismatic
                leadership helped the party gain popularity, especially among
                young voters.
              </p>

              <h5>PTI's Main Ideology</h5>
              <p>
                PTI's main ideology revolves around creating a welfare state,
                promoting education, and improving healthcare. After years of
                political struggle, PTI won the 2018 general elections, and
                Imran Khan became the Prime Minister of Pakistan, marking a
                significant milestone in the party's journey.
